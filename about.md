# About

In 2009 James Gardner and Chris Adams built a prototyle system to be able to
assign the electricity cost of running the co-working space to the people in
the building at the time. They used using digital signatures to measure
occupancy, and current cost devices to measure electricity use in Hub Islington

In 2012 Greta and the Hub Islington team set about collecting their data on
other metrics including:

* Compost
* Recycling
* Landfill
* Hot and Cold Water use
* Electricity
* Occupancy
* Number of bags of pellets used in the heaters

In 2015 James Gardner got together with the hosts to organise an event at the
hub, showing how much electricity each device used and talking a but about what
we'd be been collecting. An interactive dashbaord was demonstrated and the
event was used to come up with ideas for what the community thought they could
track.

It was decided that we'd concentrate on electricity use and waste productuction

In 2016 it became clear that custom code and analytics wasn't going to get the
team very far, or be very reproducible. We need to simplify. The result was to
keep it stupidly simple and use the tools Goolge already provide. What we came
up with is described on this site.
