# Co-ordinator

Welcome, you are the co-ordinator on the project. You're the person responsible for setting up the project and making sure everyone else does what they need to, and that the project ticks along nicely.

The first thing you should probably do is read through the other roles so that you know what everyone else is doing:

* Tech person - Can copy the template spreadsheet and teach other how to add data to it, perhaps setting up one or two custom charts the group is interested in
* Waste data collector - Everyone can get involved in this!
* Electricity data collector - Everyone can get involved in this!
* Publicist - Prints out the graphs each week and put them up on noticeboards, tweets about progress
* Analyser - Puts the collected data into the spreadsheet and checks the charts make sense
* Presenter - Runs regular meetings to talk through progress and discuss new ways of meeting the targets (or whether the targets could be changed)


## Purchases

You'll need:

* Suitcase Scales
* Electricity meter 
* Somewhere to hang the scales
* Separate bins for landfill, recycling and compost
* Lots of nin bags that won't tear when hung from a hook to be weighed

In the UK, these should be fine:

* http://www.amazon.co.uk/DIGIFLEX-Digital-Hanging-Weighing-Suitcase/dp/B002MUS34Q/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1459249335&sr=8-2&keywords=20kg+scales

We've got a 40 Kg scale, but you might not need that much.

NOTE: It is easy to get the wrong unit on the scales or for them not to be at zero. For example, we've been measuring in lb but recording that as Kg.

Make sure the energy meter has an amp rating suitable for the things you'll
plug into it. 13A is fine for single appliances that you would normally plug
into the mains anyway. Also make sure it has a watt reading. The one suggested
has a rather small display. You can pay more for ones with a larger display.


## Waste

Since you'll want to measure landfill, compost and recycling separately, you'll
want separate bins for each.

Set up separate bins for each, perhaps with a printout designed by the team to
label each one.

Then set up scales somewhere near the bins, perhaps hanging from the ceiling,
and put the waste log on the wall opposite so it is easy for the rubbish to be weighed.


Here's a template waste log you can make. Make sure the boxes are really big, because there might be quite a few sacks of rubbish to record in each box. It is also good to make sure the date ranges don't overlap. If the Anaylser always enters data into the log on Tuesday afternoons, perhaps consider anything on a Tuesday after that time as part of the next week. The Anaylser can cross off the week once they've typed it up.


See the template in [waste-log-example.txt](waste-log-example.txt)


Things to note:

* Google will consider the tech person responsible for the sheet (and hence the data and the graphs), so they have to be happy to host the sheet on their account
* The tech person will need a the email address of the Google Account of the Analyser so they can invite them to the sheet
