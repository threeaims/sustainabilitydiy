Adds up all the waste logs, and crosses out the week above at the point they
type up the data. There may be some waste left in the bins, this will have to
be recorded in the next week.


Checks that the scales are still in the right mode and reset correctly.


Note, you won't be able to plot an electricity usage graph at the end of the
first week unless the Electricity Data Collector takes a reading at the very
start of the first week. This is because the electricity meter just gives a
total value, so to be able to work out how much is used each week, we need to
know how much there was at the start of the week, and how much there was at the
end.

Put in the value 0 rather things like `N/A` or `on holiday`. Computers aren't
too clever, so will get confused with anything that isn't a number, and that will stop the chart from working. 

You can tell the Publicist or Presenter about anything that would mean the
results need to be interpreted differently from normal, but these shouldn't be in the chart itself.
